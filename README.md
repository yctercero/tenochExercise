# Tenoch Site Re-Design (Class project, not launched)

As part of a class assignment we were asked to do a site re-design. I chose to re-design a local restaurant's website. This project was done Spring 2016.

This is what the site looked like at the time I was re-designing it - http://bit.ly/2cga96t
